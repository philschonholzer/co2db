# About CO2 Database

What are the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of things.
How can we as a society fight the climate crisis if we hardly know the opponent (CO<sub>2</sub>).
With the CO<sub>2</sub> database I want to show the different CO<sub>2</sub> emitters and their emissions.
Everyone should be able to know and understand what causes how much CO<sub>2</sub>.

## Contribution

I would love for you to contribute to the CO<sub>2</sub> database. Either by contributing of emitters or by improving the database. You can find the project on Github.
