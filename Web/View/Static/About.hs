        <p>What are the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of things.</p>
        <p>How can we as a society fight the climate crisis if we hardly know the opponent (CO<sub>2</sub>).
          With the CO<sub>2</sub> database I want to show the different CO<sub>2</sub> emitters and their emissions.
          Everyone should be able to know and understand what causes how much CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        <h2>Contribution</h2>
        <p>I would love for you to contribute to the CO<sub>2</sub> database. Either by contributing of emitters or by improving the database. You can find the project on Github.</p>
